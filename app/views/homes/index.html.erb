    Spirits of the Forest is a fully functional multiplayer game. However, it does not have a playerbase, so you will likely not be able to play a game without letting me know: <a href="mailto:doug@mindbugstudios.com">doug@mindbugstudios.com</a>. Otherwise, for your convenience, here is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZZw5Zh_8yE">a brief screencast</a>, and <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cgSf0kZq2C_QLmAjvEJ6hDCn7A1S_7Cu/view?usp=sharing">here is a pdf</a> describing the project's data structures/flow, react components, game logic, and other functionality. New features, including single-player and expansions, are under development!

    "Once an age, a mythic wind lifts the veil between the spirit world and ours. Whimsical seraphs, drawn to the vigor of an ancient forest, descend through clouds to once again take up their centennial game. You are one of these seraphs â€“ a being of great power and curiosity. The life of the forest fascinates you, and you eagerly gather plant, animal, and sprite alike to add to your mystical menagerie. But beware, for you are not alone. Other beings just like yourself contest to collect the life of the forest as well!"
